# Network-Analysis
NETWORK ANALYSIS
For this project, I have picked two competing brands and did a network analysis of the tweets that are created that
mention that brand. As we know, Twitter is an interesting place where people, bots and organizations all join the conversation.
The goal of this project is to better understand the chatter around each brand, what makes each brand unique, and what makes 
each brand different. I have used network analysis to identify users that are most central to our brand and ones that are 
hyper interested in our product.

Selecting Brands
I have picked two competing brands- Uber-Jump Citibike - Lyft

Fetching Twitter Data
Registered for a Twitter Developer Account and created an application which gives an access to Token key. I have used
the Twitter API, specifically the Search Endpoint,to retrieve Tweets that mention my two brands. The API returns historical 
results for the last 7 days. That is, I have got all of the tweets sent by consumers (and other twitter users) that mentioned 
the two brand names. I have fetched all available for each brand and saved those tweets as JSON inside a zip file which I 
have uploaded in the folder here.

Python Script

I have used python for forming an edge list for further analysis.
